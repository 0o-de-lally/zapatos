# Zapatos "main-apache-2" Branch Information

**Purpose**: This branch serves as a reference snapshot of the `aptos-labs/aptos-core` repository.

**Snapshot Criteria**:
This branch includes all Pull Requests from the upstream `main` branch **up to, but not including**, the first Pull Request that introduced a new file containing the text "Innovation-Enabling Source Code" license identifier.

This ensures that this specific snapshot remains under the Apache 2.0 license (or dual MIT/Apache 2.0) as per the repository's state before the introduction of restrictive licensing in recent features.

**Current Head**:
Commit: `0e47c90c1c2d64aa00996575c6d53d2513088886`
Date: Tue Dec 9 14:11:24 2025 -0500

**Note**: This branch is strictly for reference and historical analysis of the codebase state prior to the licensing shift in specific modules.
